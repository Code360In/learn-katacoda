# Install and enable required software

Before you start building images with image builder, the software required to
perform the tasks must be installed on the system.  Specifically, the
`composer-cli` package which provides the `composer-cli` command, and the
`osbuild-composer` package which provides the back-end service used to produce
the virtual machine images.

`yum -y install composer-cli osbuild-composer`{{execute}}

Complete!

Now that the software has been successfully installed on the system, you also need to activate the `osbuild-composer` service so that the `composer-cli`
command can interact with the service that is responsible for queuing and creating the machine images.

`systemctl enable --now osbuild-composer.socket`{{execute}}

<pre class='file'>
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/osbuild-composer.socket â†’ /usr/lib/systemd/system/osbuild-composer.socket.
</pre>

Now that the service is accessible, you are ready to start working with image builder to create machine images.
