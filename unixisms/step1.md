// something about man


One thing that is essential for every Linux user to learn
is tab completion. Tab completion allows you to press the _tab_ key
to fill in the rest of the characters of the current item that you
are typing. This will only complete if you have typed enough
characters to uniquely identify one item that is available. If what
you have typed so far is not unique, then nothing will happen on the
first tab press. The second time you press tab, a list of options that
match the string you have entered will be printed.
Because of this, tab completion saves time and cuts down on mistakes.
