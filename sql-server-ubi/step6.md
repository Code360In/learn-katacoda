# Checkpoint and restore the container running SQL Server

One of Podmanâ€™s features is to be able to checkpoint and restore running containers. Podman uses CRIU (Checkpoint/Restore In Userspace) to do the actual checkpointing and restoring of the processes inside of the container. The *--leave-running* option tells podman to generate the checkpoint while keeping
the container running.

`podman container checkpoint -l --leave-running --export=/tmp/checkpoint1.tar.gz`{{execute T3}}

Without telling Podman to checkpoint the container while keeping the established TCP connection intact (--tcp-established) the checkpointing will fail. The container has been now checkpointed with all its data 

`podman container restore -l --tcp-established`{{execute T3}}
