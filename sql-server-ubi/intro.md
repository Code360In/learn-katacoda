# Goal:
After completing this scenario, users will be able to run Microsoft SQL Server 
on Red Hat Enterprise Linux(RHEL) using UBI and Red Hat container tools.

# Concepts included in this scenario:
* Download the container image that contains Microsoft SQL Server 
* Deploy the container image to run SQL Server on RHEL
* Query data in SQL Server running in a container on RHEL
* Take a checkpoint of the container, and restore the container from the checkpoint
* Generate systemd scripts to automatically start the SQL Server containers at system boot

# Example Use case:
Your infrastructure team is planning on using containerized applications, and this also means
containerized databases. They have learnt that Microsoft SQL Server 2019 offers a container image
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), and they want to start using it for building applications.
