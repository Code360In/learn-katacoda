# Locating files

Manipulating files is only useful if you can locate the file you need.

The `find` command is great for searching for files which
satisfy some specified criteria.

`find`{{execute}}


>_Note:_ An in-depth explanation of using `find` to sort by file permissions
is included in the [File Permissions Basics lab](https://lab.redhat.com/file-permissions).  

If you instead want to locate specific file contents, the `grep`
command is what you are looking for.

`grep`{{execute}}
