# Overview:

It is common for multiple users to potentially have access to the same files.
This means that understanding file permissions is a foundational skill for
any system administrator. This lab is designed to provide you with a basic
understanding of how to control who has access to various files on a system.

# Goal:

After completing this scenario, users will be able to read, understand, and
change permissions of files and directories on their system.

# Concepts included in this scenario:
* Viewing file contents with `cat`
* Viewing the last 10 lines of a file with `tail`
* Appending command outputs to a file with the `>>` operator
* Locating files that match certain criteria using `find` and `locate`
* Using `grep` with other commands to isolate a portion of their output
* Checking disk space with `df`
* Viewing and managing processes with `ps` and `top`
* Using `free` to view information about the system memory usage
