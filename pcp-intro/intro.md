# Goal:
After completing this scenario, users will be able to understand the basics of Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) in RHEL, and use PCP with Microsoft SQL Server running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux

# Concepts included in this scenario:
* Install Performance Co-Pilot packages on RHEL
* Analyze critical system resources using PCP 
* Install PMDAs for SQL Server  
* Check SQL Server query performance by running an sample analytic query with columnstores
* Change the RHEL tuned-profile for SQL Server
* Re-query SQL Server with columnstores to see the impact of the mssql tuned profile

>**BACKGROUND:** The first step to solving performance issues is being able to diagnose the issue. If you don’t have performance metrics and the ability to analyze them, you’re just relying on guesswork. One of the popular tools for performance monitoring on Linux is Performance Co-Pilot (PCP), and we’ll show you how to get started using PCP on Red Hat Enterprise Linux to collect and analyze data to solve your performance mysteries.
