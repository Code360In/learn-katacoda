# Goal:
After completing this scenario, you will be able to use ansible to easily deploy Red Hat Identity Management (IdM) across your 
RHEL servers, and run IdM health-check to monitor if the IdM services are properly configured and running.

# Concepts included in this scenario:
* Using ansible playbooks to deploy IdM across RHEL servers
* Starting and stopping the IdM server and services
* Creating a user on the IdM server
* Run health-check to monitor if any IdM services are not running properly
 
# Example Use case:
Specifically designed for the linux environment, IdM makes it simple to manage users, user groups, systems and services 
in native linux, while still providing the option to interoperate with Microsoft Active Directory. In order to reduce 
administrative overhead, streamline provisioning and improve security, your sysadmins are looking for a centralized way 
to manage identities on RHEL.
