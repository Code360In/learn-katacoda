# Goal:
After completing this scenario, users will be able to configure systems using
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) System Roles.

# Concepts included in this scenario:
* Installing software needed for RHEL System Roles
* Configuring a system using RHEL System Roles
* Adding new configuration using RHEL System Roles to apply to systems
* Applying updated configuration settings to systems

# Example Usecase:
You have a set of database servers, these servers need kernel settings and
time settings applied to them.  Additionally, you want to record terminal
sessions for auditing.  When a change needs to be made to the configuration,
you want to apply the changes to all your database servers to keep them all
updated with the same configuration options.
