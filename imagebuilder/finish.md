# Influence Image Builder with your feedback!
We are conducting a [survey](https://redhatdg.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_aWQfWV5jrPSufCB?link=katacoda) to explore new design concepts for creating customized gold operating system images. The survey may take only 5-10 minutes but the answers you provide will have a direct impact on the future of Red Hat tools and solutions.
