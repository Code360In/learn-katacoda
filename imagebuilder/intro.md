# Goal:
After completing this scenario, users will be able to create customized Red Hat Enterprise Linux images using Image Builder plugin within Web Console.

# Concepts included in this scenario:
* Creating a custom blueprint to use for machine image creation
* Building a custom Red Hat Enterprise Linux machine image
* Monitoring the image build process

# Example Usecase:
Using Image Builder to make system images would be a consistent, repeatable
way to build the same installed system, but output the image to different
cloud formats for use in a hybrid cloud environment.

# Influence Image Builder with your feedback!
We are conducting a [survey](https://redhatdg.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_aWQfWV5jrPSufCB?link=katacoda) to explore new design concepts for creating customized gold operating system images. The survey may take only 5-10 minutes but the answers you provide will have a direct impact on the future of Red Hat tools and solutions.
