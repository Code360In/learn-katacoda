# Goal:
After completing this scenario, users will be able to use, and 
customize Red Hat Enterprise Linux's system-wide cryptographic policy.  
The scenario uses the Apache web server as the example application.

# Concepts included in this scenario:
* Verify the current system-wide cryptographic policy setting
* Customize the current cryptographic policy setting
* Restart applications after a cryptographic policy update
* Verify that the application settings to comply with the modified cryptograpic policies

# Example Use case:
Due to weaknesses in the SHA-1 algorithm and to align to industry standards, your security team requires disallowing SHA1 hashes and signatures to improve security across your platform.
