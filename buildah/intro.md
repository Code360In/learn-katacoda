After completing this scenario, users will be able to build images from scratch or existing base images using **buildah** and other host based tools.

# Concepts included in this scenario:
* Initializing a working container for image building
* Using buildah commands to modify a working container
* Modfiying a working container with standard system tools
* Creating an application image from a working container

# Example Usecase:
Using *podman* with a Containerfile or Dockerfile input is a common way to build containers from base images. However, this lab, Building containers with **buildah**, provides better control over layer creation and image contents.
