Unlike interactive containers, detached containers are stopped using __podman stop <CONTAINER ID>__.

`podman stop $(podman ps -a | grep Up | cut -d" " -f1)`{{execute T1}}

In the command above, we use a bit of bash scripting to determine the __CONTAINER ID__ as it is going to be a value unique to each container image.

You can verify that the container is now exited:

`podman ps -a`{{execute T1}}

<pre class="file">
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                         COMMAND               CREATED        STATUS                     PORTS                   NAMES

</pre>

Also, if you access the __Container Service__ tab in the lab interface, it will now report unable to connect; as the container offering the Apache web server is no longer available.
